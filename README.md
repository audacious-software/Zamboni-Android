# Zamboni-Android
An in-app updater derived from the recently-departed HockeyApp in-app updater.

***Note that this is is almost entirely derived from the original MIT-licensed HockeyApp Android SDK.***

This has been updated for AndroidX UI libraries and will be updated to address forthcoming changes in permissions and APIs for installing updates within apps from outside the Play Store and other centralized storefronts.
